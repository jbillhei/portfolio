### ChromaTron MK3

Some photos from my ChromaTron build in 2013, and few shots of some of the installations.

This is a 16 unit lighting system that mounts on conventional mic stands.  Power is supplied by lithium-polymer battery packs (or 12 volt adapters).  They are wirelessly networked and controllable from a laptop or iPad.
